# Superstore-Data-Model

Project Description:

"Superstore Data Model" is a project that showcases the design and implementation of a data model for a fictional online superstore. The project leverages SQL to create a comprehensive data model consisting of fact tables, dimension tables, and an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to represent the relationships between different entities in the data.

Key Features:

Fact and Dimension Tables:

The data model includes well-structured fact and dimension tables that efficiently capture various aspects of the superstore's transactions, products, customers, and time-related data.
Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):

The ERD visually represents the relationships between different entities in the data, providing a clear overview of how the data is connected and organized.
Data Analysis with Window Functions:

The project demonstrates the use of SQL window functions to perform advanced data analysis on the superstore data. Window functions enable complex aggregations and ranking operations within specified windows of data.
Sample Queries and Insights:

The repository includes sample SQL queries that showcase the capabilities of the data model and provide valuable insights into the superstore's sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.
